# Schedex

Scheduler for node-red which allows you to enter on/off times as 24hr clock (e.g. 01:10) or suncalc events (e.g. goldenHour).
It also allows you to offset times and randomise the time within the offset.

Inspired by Pete Scargill's [BigTimer](http://tech.scargill.net/big-timer/)

__NOTE: When upgrading from versions prior to 1.0.0, you will see a message for each Schedex node in the Node-RED debug window. This message is to advise that the Schedex configuration changed slightly in version 1.0.0
in order to accomodate days of the week when scheduling. To remedy, simply edit each Schedex node, tick the days of the week you want Schedex enabled and re-deploy.__

# Installation
 
    $ cd ~/.node-red
    $ npm install node-red-contrib-schedex
 
# Configuration 

## Schedule

The scheduling days allow you to choose which days of the week to schedule events. Unticking all days
will suspend scheduling.

## Suspending scheduling

The 'Suspend scheduling' checkbox allows you to disable time scheduling. If scheduling is suspended, 
Schedex will only generate output events upon receipt of input 'on' and 'off' events (see below).

This setting is provided for the situation where you temporarily don't want time based activation 
and don't want to rewire your Node-RED flow.
    
## Times
    
The times can be a 24 hour time or a [suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) event:


| Time        | Description                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `00:00 ... 23:59`       | 24hr time                     |
| `sunrise`       | sunrise (top edge of the sun appears on the horizon)                     |
| `sunriseEnd`    | sunrise ends (bottom edge of the sun touches the horizon)                |
| `goldenHourEnd` | morning golden hour (soft light, best time for photography) ends         |
| `solarNoon`     | solar noon (sun is in the highest position)                              |
| `goldenHour`    | evening golden hour starts                                               |
| `sunsetStart`   | sunset starts (bottom edge of the sun touches the horizon)               |
| `sunset`        | sunset (sun disappears below the horizon, evening civil twilight starts) |
| `dusk`          | dusk (evening nautical twilight starts)                                  |
| `nauticalDusk`  | nautical dusk (evening astronomical twilight starts)                     |
| `night`         | night starts (dark enough for astronomical observations)                 |
| `nadir`         | nadir (darkest moment of the night, sun is in the lowest position)       |
| `nightEnd`      | night ends (morning astronomical twilight starts)                        |
| `nauticalDawn`  | nautical dawn (morning nautical twilight starts)                         |
| `dawn`          | dawn (morning nautical twilight ends, morning civil twilight starts)     |


## Offsets

The on and off time can have an offset. This is specified in minutes:

 - -ve number brings the time forward. E.g. if the time is dusk and offset is -60, a message will be generated 60 minutes before dusk.
 - +ve number delays the time by the specified number of minutes

## Randomisation of times

Both on and off times can be randomised by ticking "Use random time within offset period". For example, if you specify dusk with
an offset of -60 minutes, every day a message will be generated at a random time in a 60 minute window before dusk.
  
## Inputs
  
You can wire inject nodes to the input of this node. To turn on manually, simply send a payload of 'on'. To turn off manually,
send a payload of 'off'. Injecting on or off causes this node emit the configured topic and payload. The manual mode is reset when the next on or off time is reached.

## Programmatic Control
  
This node supports programmatic time control as well as configuration via the NodeRED UI. 

**It is very important to note that properties set programmatically in this manner are transient. They will not persist over a NodeRED restart 
or redeploy!**

You can set the following:
 
| Property        | Type                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `msg.payload.suspended` | Boolean: true will suspend scheduling, false will resume scheduling |
| `msg.payload.ontime` | String value as specified in the table above for time configuration |
| `msg.payload.ontopic` | String value emitted as the topic for the on event |
| `msg.payload.onpayload` | String value emitted as the payload for the on event |
| `msg.payload.onoffset` | Number value as specified above for Offset configuration |
| `msg.payload.onrandomoffset` | Boolean value as specified above in Randomisation of Times |
| `msg.payload.offtime` | String value as specified in the table above for time configuration |
| `msg.payload.offtopic` | String value emitted as the topic for the off event |
| `msg.payload.offpayload` | String value emitted as the payload for the off event |
| `msg.payload.offoffset` | Number value as specified above for Offset configuration |
| `msg.payload.offrandomoffset` | Boolean value as specified above in Randomisation of Times |

 
 
Alternatively, you can send msg.payload as a string with the following values:

| Example msg.payload        | Description|
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `suspended true` | true will suspend scheduling, false will resume scheduling |
| `ontime 12:00` | Time as specified in the table above for time configuration |
| `ontopic my_topic` | Override the topic for the on event (no spaces) |
| `onpayload my_payload` | Override the payload for the on event (no spaces) |
| `onoffset 30` | Override the offset for the on event |
| `onrandomoffset true` | Override the random offset for the on event |
| `offtime dusk` | Time as specified in the table above for time configuration |
| `offtopic my_topic` | Override the topic for the off event (no spaces) |
| `offpayload my_payload` | Override the payload for the off event (no spaces) |
| `offoffset -30` | Override the offset for the off event |
| `offrandomoffset false` | Override the random offset for the off event |
| `ontime 16:30 onoffset 60 onrandomoffset true` | Override the time, offset and random offset for the on event |
